<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';"><strong>This will not be an april fools day jokes as usual.</strong></span></span>

<span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:medium;">Instead, I am asking all of u sincerely to help me out.  As u may not know, i proposed to my girlfriend last night (past midnight, actually today) and asked, 'will u marry me?'.  she replied "why at this time?" 'Cause i don't wanna wait by tomorrow which might seems to be fake' i answered. Finally, i got a yes!!! yeah!!!!</span>

<span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:medium;">As an engineering student, we intentionally make the wedding date on World IPv6 day. A little bit geek? maybe or just make our love robust connected put it another way.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:medium;">If u could, pls click the donation icon below and make $1 donate to help me buy a wedding ring. Also, if u want, your can leave ur name and address after the donation. i will send out a card on my wedding day, i promise.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:medium;">You might wanna ask why on this day.-i cant wait till tomorrow even if today makes it seems like an itchy palm.</span>
