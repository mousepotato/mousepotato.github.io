# How to be efficient 如何高效
----------------
		
## 1. Efficiency comes from familiarity and simplicity.

高效来源于熟练，俗语说：“熟能生巧”。同样的，高效来源于简单。简单不意味着更少。 简单是对完美的追求，达到某种圆满 (completeness)，是为高效的上限（upper bound），增一分减一分都会招致破坏。正如 Albert Einstein 所说：

> Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.



## 2. Admitting your incapabilities, say no to 1000 things.

You have to be focus in order to be efficient.

See [Steve Jobs: Innovation is Saying "No" to 1,000 things](http://zurb.com/article/744/steve-jobs-innovation-is-saying-no-to-1-0)
> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying "no" to 1,000 things.

Things you need to always keep in mind like [You next GTD plan](http://anotherbug.com/blog/2013/05/27/what-to-do-next-for-your-GTD-plan/).

## 3.	Be well organized.

By saying organized, I am not meaning to have your stuff in order or a neat table. _Organized_ means that you have a set of well defined _living style_, _systems_ or _architectures_ or whatever that could help you do every kind of jobs. You have to define them in advance and purify them for life long. See [Establish and accumulate your little system](http://www.read.org.cn/html/1641-establish-and-accumulate-your-little-system.html).



That't it!!
